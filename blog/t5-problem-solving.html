      <h6>Tech Musings</h6>
        <p>The time I was stuck in a simple issue was while trying to get a program work which had to check if the
           color of a figure was green. I was not doing the actual checking and spend sometime to figure out. I went through each step to figure out what was happening at each step.
           The time I wrote the blog page using semantic strucutre looked very polished as well as made all the blogs have a
           common look and feel to it.
           I referenced pages like stackoverflow and google search. I tend to understand videos easier and hence my go to place is
           youtube.
           I learned about researching and looking through the code.<p>

        <p>I am yet to use pseudocode as a problem solving method. As mentioned googling for solutions is my default practise. Trying something and seeing
           the outpput is also a preferred method. I am still not comfortable in reading the errors. Asking for help is not done frequently as I find it
           hard to understand at times another stream of thought from a different person. Reflection can help with the disappointments when it comes to fixing
           errors.

      <h6>.map function</h6>

      <h6>.filter function</h6>
        <p>filter function filters an array as per a given condition and outputs a new array with filtered values.</p>
      <h6>.reduce function</h6>
        <p>reduce function reduces an array to a single value by performing the required operation on the array elements. Example addition
          performed on the array elements.</p>
