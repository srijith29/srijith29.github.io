      <h6>Compare JS to HTML/CSS</h6>
        <p>JavaScript gives functionality to the webpage while HTML gitves the strucuture and CSS gitves
           the style
        </p>
        <h6>Control flow and Loops</h6>
          <p>Control flow determines the execution sequence. Accordingly control flow can be sequential ie follow one statement
             after another, conditional ie execute if a condition is met or even halt execution if the exit condition is met.
             Loops are strucutres by which the control flow is caused to iterate a multiple number of times until the exit
             condition is met. Control Flow can be compared to our daily morning rituals after waking up where one job is executed
             after another. Brushing our teeth can be compared to a loop which iterates the action until the exit condition called "clean teeth "
             is met.
          </p>
          <h6>Data Access - Arrays and Objects</h6>
            <p> Arrays uses indexes to access the data for example arr[0] will give the data stored in the 1st location of the array.
                Objects use properties to access the data. For eg myObj[name].
            </p>
          <h6>Functions</h6>
            <p>Functions are reusable pieces of codes which can be run using a function call. Functions are an easy way to simplfy the program without the
               need to replicate.
