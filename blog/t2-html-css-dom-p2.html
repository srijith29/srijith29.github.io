       <h2>Grid based system</h2>
        <p>A grid based system is a design system where the websites are divided into grids.
          Usually the sites are divided into 12 columns. The combination of different number of columns
          forms a space for the contents of the site to reside. For example  there can be a content that can
          occupy 6 such grids and width of the space created by that grid can be calculated as 6/12 or 50%. Only
          2 such spaces can exist for that particular row (50% * 2).

        <h2>Hype about resonsive webpages</h2>
        <p>Gone are the days when websites were delivered to computer screens of the fixed viewport.
          Nowadays a site needs to render correctly in any medium it is accessed with. It could be a monitor, tv,
          laptop, mobile phones of varying display etc. Hence to design sites capable of adjusting itself to these
          changes is of great importance. This is primarily achieved by using percentage values of display dimensions like
          width and height instead of fixed pixels. Another feature that allows for responsive design is the @media function
          which enables to design outcomes specific to output conditions.

        <h2>Semantic Structure</h2>
        <p>A semantic structure not only gives structural inputs to the browser to render a webpage but also
          allows users to understand the contents. For example, the header tag implies that it is where the header
          details like logos or navigation bar can be found. Another good example is an article tag. An article tag tells the reader and browser that the content of it is independent of the other contents of the site. This article tag could be subdivided using section tags where each section can contain related or unrelated info pertaining the article. Similarly, a footer tag can help user and browser to identify the contents
          such as links, copyrights, sitemaps etc. Search engines make use of the semantics to display relevant search results and hence for search engine optimisation it is important to have a semantic design of the webpage.
