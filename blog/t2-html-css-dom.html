      <h2>Analogy to Webpages</h2>
        <p>A webpage is primarily made in HTML, CSS and DOM. Webpage can be compared to a building. HTML tags represent the materials that build a building like cement, bricks etc. It gives structure to a webpage.
          CSS is like paint, wallpaper etc, anything to improve the aesthetics of a building which help to stay there more enjoyable. Similarly, CSS makes site pleasing to the eye and improves the user experience.
          DOM or Document Object Model is like the blueprint of the building. Like a blueprint helps a builder to construct a building, DOM helps the browsers to construct the web pages.
          DOM will have a tree structure where parent and children will be defined.

      <h2>The box model</h2>
        <p>If we inspect the internal structure of a webpage and its elements, we can
          find that all the structures are nothing but boxes. The various
          elements can be divided and subdivided into smaller boxes. These boxes
          occupy fixed width and height. This is achieved by dividing a page into rows and columns.</p>
