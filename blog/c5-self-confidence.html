      <h6>Relationship between mindfulness and self awareness </h6>
        <p>Mindfulness aids the process of self awareness. The practise of mindfulness is esssential to know ones suttle emotions and
          the effects it has.</p>
        <p>"My emotions are not me" is a practice in various traditions where an active and deliberate differentiation is bought between the self and
            emotions it undergoes. With continous practice the practitioner can be a witness to his own emotions and  can choose to be or not to be
            affected by it. We know in the spiritual world our body can be compared to the clothes we wear and hence we say "my body" is not me. But seldom
            we do this when we think about our mind. We always have the false identification with our mind thinking that its us. But again our mind is
            also an impression of all our experiences recorded over a period of time and our mind always depends on this recording to provide us with suggestions
            or solutions. Hence this is the reason why when one person sees threat other sees opportunity. </p>
