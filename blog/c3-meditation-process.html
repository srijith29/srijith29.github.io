       <h6>My thoughts on meditation before reading the chapter</h6>
         <p>Since I had a bit of experience in meditation and mindfulness with
            various traditions, I had a good understanding of meditation. Meditation as
            per my understanding is a very personal affair. You can try and learn methods or
            follow instructions but the one that works might be the one you
            developed over a period of time and might contain inputs from various sources or none.
         </p>
       <h6>New learnings</h6>
          <p>The concept of meta-mindfulness was intersting as well as the analogy with learning to cycle.
            Another learning I had from the chapter is the importance of forgiving oneself when you loose your
            concentration.
          </p>
       <h6>Meditation technique</h6>
          <p>One technique that stands out is the method of delaying the response by analysing the cause and being mindful of the
            response if we choose to respond.
          </p>
        <h6>Musings</h6>
          <p>Meditation is a journey where one discovers ones own path</p>
