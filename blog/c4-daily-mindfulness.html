      <h6>What did you learn from minfulness conversation?</h6>
        <p>Mindfulness conversation consists of 3 steps. 1. Mindful listening, 2. Looping and 3. Dipping.
          Mindful listening is giving complete undivided attention to the speaker. Looping is the process by which
          we repeat what the speaker had conveyed to their satisfaction and to repeat it until we get it right. Dipping is listening to
          our own internal distraction while performing the other processes and acknowledging it.
          I will be using dipping a lot as it can be used in any formal or informal setting even without the participation of the other person
        </p>
      <h6>Musings</h6>
        <p>One of the practises I had involved a timer for mindfulness. It is to spend 1 minute every hour practising mindfulness taking mind off from
            whatever job it is doing at that moment. It oftens gives a relaxing break.
