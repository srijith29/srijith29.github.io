    <h1>Welcome to my 2nd blog</h1>
    <h2> Time and Habit</h2>

    <p>
      I have tried some of the habit and time management techniques. From the materials
      I have gained some new insights as well. I have meditated and have been exposed to
      different types from different schools (one of the perks of being from India). I have experienced peace,
      tranquility and above all happiness during my practises. The biggest challenge for me in continuting
      with any of those practises has been reaching a state where I begin to see futility in achievements and
      it stops me from going after a bucket list or that comfortable life. I might have to change my
      perspective from an achievement mode to a self discovery one.

       I am currently planning to do the promodoro technique as a way to keep myself focussed for short bursts. I particularly
       like the fact that its doable as it requires focus for 25 minutes. The other challenge would be managing the breaks
       as I tend to wander off for hours during breaks. I think is important to have quality breaks not quantity.

       The video on habit formation has given me some great ideas on how to create a small habit and small habits over a period
       makes larger one. I like the blog where it says starting small is very important and confidence is a result of doing. The
       technique of making new habits by breaking it into very small manageabale chunks and repeating it just after an established
       routine or habit is one thing I will start experimenting with.
