    <h1>Welcome to my 2nd blog</h1>
    <h2> Time and Habit</h2>

    <p>
      I have tried some of the habit and time management techniques. From the materials
      I have gained some new insights as well. I have meditated and have been exposed to
      different types from different schools(one of the perks of being from India). I have experienced peace
      tranquility and above all happiness during my practises. The biggest challenge for me to continue
      with any of those practises has been it brings me to the state where I begin to see futility in achievements and
      it stops me from going after a bucket list or that comfortable life. My challenge is to find that spot where I
      am not doing something for having a sense of achievement but doing for some sort of self discovery.

       I am currently planning to do the promodoro technique as way to keep myself focussed for short bursts. I particularly
       like the fact that its doable as it requires you be focussed for 25 minutes. The other challenge would be managing the breaks
       as I tend to wander off for hours once I take a break. I think is important to have quality  breaks not quantity.

       The video on habit formation has given me some great ideas on how to create a small habit and small habits over a period
       makes larger one. I like the blog where it says starting small is very important and confidence is a result of doing. The
       technique of making new habits by breaking it into very small manageabale chunks and repeating it just after an established
       routine or habit is one thing I will start experimenting with.
