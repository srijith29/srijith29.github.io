      <p>This is my first week on EDA and I am with Harakeke cohort. As any newbie I am currently trying to figure out how GIT and
       GITHUB work. There are lot of materials to cover and lot of things to learn. Watching the video by Shereef has given me
       some idea of what to expect and what is expected of me.

       <p>I am impressed by the fact that they give lot of importance to empathy and creating a space of inclusion. I am yet to experience the
       team and the teachers but expecting positive outcome from the entire experience.
       The culture of inclusion is awesome and I can see people contributing and working in pairs or teams. I am hoping that
       the cohort members are all having the same mindset and carry the value of EDA.

        <p>I am expecting this to be very challenging. To make a team of different individuals with different priorities to have the
       same mindset. I am interested to see how it is implemented. As with anyone starting a bootcamp, I am quite nervous and
       looking forward to see how I respond to it.
