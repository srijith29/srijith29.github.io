      <h6>What is a responsive site?</h6>
      <p>
        A responsive site adapts to the various screens of different screen size or viewport. The most important function of a
        responsive site is to deliver content with good user experience regardless of the device used. This is acheieved by asking
        the browser to render contents differently for different screens.

      <h6>What is a mobile first design?</h6>
      <p>Mobile first design as the name suggests has the base design optimised for mobile screens. They start with basic defaults
        optimised for mobile screens and add features for bigger screens. This is different from the apporaches of scaling down to
        accomodate smaller devices. The advantage of mobile first design or scaling up is that the smaller devices only need to display
        components optimised for them rather than having to render the enitre features as with the case of scaling down.

      <h6>What are frameworks?</h6>
      <p>Frameworks are pieces of code that gives structure that can be resused to save time in coding. Frameworks allow standardization of
        pages. The disadvantage of frameworks could be in having to use the entire framework even though one will be implementing a part of it.

      <h6>Wireframes and uses</h6>
      <p> Wireframes are primarily used to mockup a site. This gives us a chance to evaluate a site before actually coding it up. Wireframing
        also gives us a chance to select the appopriate tools and get consent from all stake holders before exection.
      </p>
      <p>The aspect of wireframes I found difficult was finding the right tool to make the wireframe.</p>
